This repository contains projects and code written for math-specific courses I took during my time at the University of Minnesota. 
There are two primary courses I took (math modeling and my senior research project). 
Most files are for homework problems pertaining to the math modeling course. 
The Poisson Simulation file was used when I was exploring stochastic processes as part of my senior research project.
